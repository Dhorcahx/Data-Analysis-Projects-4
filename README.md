### Data Modelling
Model View
:---------------:
![](Model.png)
This model has just one fact table with 10 columns

### Visualisation 

1. Visualisation

The visuals report comprise of slicers, text box, bar charts;
Slicer                    |    Bar chart              |    Text Box

Slicers - 
These are the main controllers of the visual. The narrow vast information to aid in getting more accurate answers for the problem statements

Text Box -
This one can type in findings from analyse data to give more clarity

Bar Charts - 
Provide changing but accurate results based off of values chosen in the slicers  

When slicer is interacted with, it then gives a change in the visual to give answers
